# Sonic Minesweeper

Minesweeper meets Sonic the Hedgehog.

Minesweeper was one of our first challenges at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/) and was to help us learn more about objects and arrays -- how to access properties, loop through an array of objects, etc. I decided to take the base challenge and theme it to Sonic the Hedgehog, one of my favourite games as a kid.

There are 3 difficulties which determines the grid size, and mine locations are randomly generated.
